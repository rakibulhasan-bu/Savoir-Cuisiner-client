## About The Project

Welcome to my France Chef Website! My website is designed to showcase the talent and expertise of some of the most renowned chefs in France. I have carefully selected 8 top chefs and provided their primary information such as name, image, rating, and experience on my homepage.

In addition to the chefs' section, I have also included other pages such as About, Contact, Blog, and a beautiful Testimonial and Statistics section to provide you with a comprehensive experience.

One of the most exciting features of my website is the ability to view the chef's recipes by clicking on the 'Show Recipe' button. If you are logged in, you will be able to view the chef's recipe details. If you are not logged in, you will be redirected to the login page for a private route system. My login page provides validation and authentication with Firebase and allows you to authenticate with your email and password, as well as with your Google or Github accounts using a pop-up window.

My recipe page displays a list of recipe items, with each item showing the recipe name, rating, price, ingredients, and cooking method. You can also save your favorite recipes by clicking on the 'Favorite' button, which will change the color from black to red.

I hope you enjoy using our website and exploring the culinary world of France!
